## [0.6a] - 2025-12-28

### Changed
- **Score-based principle explicit**: Added Core Design Principle in Executive Summary clarifying VAP-AT is fundamentally score-based; Threshold Designations are "optional interpretive layers"
- **EU AI Act article alignment**: Corrected Art.12 (logging) and Art.19 (retention) mapping; tamper-evidence positioned as "evidentiary robustness" beyond baseline compliance
- **Threshold Designation wording**: Changed from "Meets EU AI Act..." to "VAP-AT Auditability Threshold – EU AI Act Art.12/19 aligned" to prevent misinterpretation as legal compliance certification
- **Public Registry matrix**: Restructured from disclosure-level columns to viewer-based columns (Public / NDA Viewers / Assessed & Regulators)
- **Assessment Status terminology**: Unified terminology from "Certification Status" to "Assessment Status"; removed binary pass/fail language throughout

### Added
- **Pilot CAB Impartiality Safeguards**: 5 safeguard measures for Pilot CAB #1 (VeritasChain株式会社) including independent cross-check, external majority impartiality committee, 20%+ spot audits, conflict disclosure, and Phase 2 transition conditions
